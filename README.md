## Introduction
The "TMDB Poster Extension" is a browser extension that adds a poster next to each movie and actor entry on the TMDB website. The poster is displayed in a small box on the left side of the entry. The box is positioned to the left of the entry's title and overview, and it is sized to fit the entry's height.

The extension applies visual enhancements to the movie and actor entries, such as styling the table rows, adding shadows, and applying background filters to improve the overall aesthetic appeal.

The extension utilizes the TMDB API to retrieve movie data, including the movie poster URL. The poster is then displayed alongside each movie or actor entry on the TMDB website, providing users with a visual representation of the movie or actor.
